Some Scripts that might be helpful

- ``configure-regional-settings-{region by ISO-3166-1 with country and language}.ps1``
  - Script to configure a Windows device to use specific regional settings. I am using this script with the Azure VM Extension ``CustomScriptExtension`` to configure a Windows Server to use a specific regional format for all users.
